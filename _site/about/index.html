  <h1>About Alora Yurts</h1>
  <p><img src="http://alorayurts.com/assets/img/almunecar-2018/0014.jpg" alt="Pool at Alora Yurts" /></p>

<p>At the amazing new site which is accessed up a winding road into the hills north of Almunecar, we have three yurts and three separate accommodation dwellings. All are individually furnished with an eclectic mix of delights from around the globe which are a visual work of art in themselves and a feast for the senses.</p>

<p>The hand painted Mongolian yurts are beautiful spaces with comfy beds, lush bedding, quirky furniture all lit by candlelight and with a wood burner for those cooler winter evenings. Each of the yurts, are positioned down tracks to take advantage of the views , they each have their own compost loo, seating areas and outdoor bed for stargazing the sky is amazing as no light pollution.</p>

<p>The three dwellings each contain two double bedrooms with a lounge and small kitchen area with fridge and gas hob where guests can make tea &amp; coffee. All have open fires that can be lit in the winter months making this an ideal destination for breaks any time of the year. Dwellings can be rented either as sole occupancy if just one room is required or, at a lower rate if two rooms are rented together making this a great option for friends or groups. In addition, each dwelling has access to its own private outdoor space. The site is perfect for a romantic break with a loved one or as a honeymoon destination.</p>

<p>Alora Yurts at the Hideaway offers a safe, tranquil haven for many solo travelers who can find complete relaxation at this site. Customers generally choose to eat together each evening so always a great opportunity to meet new friends and fellow travelers.</p>

<p>This site is also an ideal venue for larger groups or family holidays as it is possible to book the whole site. A bar area with undercover area sits above the pool area which is suitable for weddings and celebrations and could seat over 40 people easily or alternatively is a great dance floor!</p>

<p>Loved as children are regrettably young children are only allowed with a whole site group booking.</p>
