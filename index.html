introText: "Alora yurts have been operating since 2006, originally as York Yurts in
  the UK and from 2010 to the warmer climate of Andalusia in Southern Spain. \n\nFor
  the past few years we have set up wonderfully relaxing environments in magical places
  in the Region of Andalucia to run our unique, and incredibly popular Yurt experience
  hideaways. The aim has always been to create a laid back and relaxing environment
  for visitors to escape the pressures of everyday life back home.\n"
